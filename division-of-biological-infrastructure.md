# Division of Biological Infrastructure Presentation

The primary purpose of this presentaiton was to discuss ways to seek funding for the development of bioinformatics
infrastructure from the NSF. I didn't begin taking notes immediately, so these notes are somewhat incomplete.

## Sustaining Infrastructure for Biological Research

This seems to be good for us except that it doesn't support new development. There is a finite budget for this, and the
anticipated budget is $5 million. This seems pretty competitive, so I doubt we'll be able to get much from this.

## Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation

This supports the development and deployment of robust, reliable and sustainable data and software
cyberinfrastructure. This is a cross-directorate opportunity, so it's not limited to infrastructure desgined to support
bioinformatics research. The budget is about $34 million per year.

## Support for Cyberinfrastructure in the Directorate of Geosciences

Our CI is general purpose, so this could apply, although we've never targeted geosciences in the past.

## CISE: Information Integration and Informatics Research

Looking for new innovations in Computer Science, including the data lifecycle, analytics, data management, among other
things. They're particularly interested in knowledge bases, including ontology construction, and knowledge sharing
methods.

## NSF/DMS: Mathematical Biology Program

Supports any research that applies mathematical innovation to biological research. This doesn't seem to apply to us
directly.

## DMS-SBE-BIO: DCL for RAISE Proposals

Funding for incorporating human behavior in epidemiological models.

## Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering

Goal is to identify and capitalize on opportunities for major scientific and engineering breakthroughs. They're
particularly interested in applying new innovations to difficult challenges.

## Computational, Bioinformatics and Biocomputin in the CISE Directorate

Explores opportunities at the intersection of biology and computer science, with a specific focus on activities that
advance the understanding of computing and communication processes.
