# Noble Reach Meeting - 2023-12-13

## Summarize

This probably isn't something that anyone else hasn't already said, but I thought this might be a useful summary.

### CyVerse vs Cloud Providers

- AWS, GCP, and Azure exist at a lower level of abstraction. They provide tools that can allow users to perform the same
  tasks that we enable, but using them is a heavier lift. We have pre-packaged utilities that they don't have.
- As far as I'm aware, the data sharing and metadata models aren't as refined as ours. The provide raw tools that can be
  used to provide these features, but once again, they're a heavier lift.
- These tools also aren't designed to show researchers a summary of the analyses that they've performed.

#### Features Not Available from Cloud Providers

- Pre-packaged analysis tools.
- Ability to easily add more analysis tools.
- Ability to quickly create analysis pipelines.
- No need to provision low level resources to enable computation.
- No need to provision storage for your data.
- Hierachichal metadata model.
- Some data provenance capabilities.
- Simplified permission model.
- Data ingress/egress methods: iRODS, WebDAV, SFTP, S3, Filesystem Mounts.
