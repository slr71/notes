# Waterdeep

## 2024-07-20

When we awake after staying the night in the Troll Skull Inn, we go out to discover that a fireball has exploded and
that there are several corpses. We ask around and hear that someone went toward the bent nail. Someone else tells us
that whatever took something out of the gnome's pocket was not a human, but something that looks like a puppet without
strings. We talk to a young boy that has a necklace that fell into a rain barrel.

We start walking toward Troll Skull Alley and the sergeant comes up to us to ask if we were still investigating. Because
of her involvement, Maeve knows that bodies are frequently taken to a local morgue and clerics are brought in to cast
preservation spells. We learn that the description of the thing that took something out of the rock gnome's pocket
sounds like one of the automota that march in local parades.

Maeve speaks to the owner of the bent nail, Tally, a half-elf who tells us that he hasn't had any customers this
morning. The temple of Gond is in the Sea Ward to the west of us. We walk towards the Temple of Gond. The house of
Inspired Hands looks like a combination between a temple and a workshop. A figure on top of one of the spires releases a
bird into the air which does a couple of flips then veers trowards us. The bird hits Mystiq, and we look up to see where
the automaton is gone.

We enter the temple. A dragonborn priestess approaches us and asks us if she can help us. A nimblewright called Nim was
gifted to the temple by a Lantanese Wizard. Nim is unique because it is conscious. We ask if we can speak with Nim. The
priestess offers to have us follow her. A spiral staircase goes up to a door. She tries the door, and it's locked. She
looks confused and says that she doesn't recognize the lock. We open the door and see Nim trying to hide in the back of
the room.

Nim created another nimblewright recently, and believes that they are the onethat attacked us. Nim created a
nimblewright detector that we can use to find the nimblewright that attacked us. If we destroy the other nimblewright,
the temple will give us 500 GP.

We ask Nim if he knows a good place to start looking. The other nimblewright doesn't ahve a name. I look up and see one
of the Gryphon riders flying above the town. Polly has a message to go to Blackstaff. We walk that way, and we don't
notice anything. We see Blackstaff tower. And staring at it give us a queasy feeling and a feeling that we're being
watched. A woman walks out and says that they've been expecting us. She asks us to follow her inside; we simply walk
through the wall and we're inside.

The inside is very clean and orderly. There's a place to leave cloaks, hats and outer footwear. There are steps going up
to some double doors. There are also doorways going to the left and the right. The woman who invited us in goes through
the door in the right. The room that we're in is minimalist. Jester thinks about a unicorn, and a unicorn appears on the
wall then disappears. A woman in black robe with a black staff, not particularly ornate greets us and welcomes us to
waterdeep. We have an invitation to join the wizards.

She asks us if she can help us. We tell her about the nimblewright and ask if she has any leads. We get information
about one of the Gryphon riders. She guides us to the castle ward and gives us the name of a Gryphon rider named
Liutenant George (sp)? We head to the stables and ask about the Liutenant. We notice someone who seems to be in
charge. He has a braided pony tail and a braided beard. He has a somewhat northern accent. Maeve says that she likes his
beard. He asks us how he can help us, and we hand him the note. He offers to train us to ride the Gryphons. We get take
some lessons to get certified. Maeve takes one of the Gryphons and detects a signal near a villa a few alleys away from
Troll Skull Manor near Seradon Street. She comes back to tell us.

We go over the villa. It's walled in and appears to be fairly secure. Maeve asks who lives there. Someone tells us that
Lord and Lady Gralhund (sp?) live there. The villa has 12' high stone walls with ornate iron gates. We can see a yard
with a two story brick mansion. Maeve casts invisibility on Mystiq, who flies to a balcony on the manison and hears an
obvious battle. She looks through windows in the doors but doesn't see anyone. She checks the door and springs a needle
trap. She picks the lock and goes in. As she goes in, a woman wearhing a breastplate with a rapier and a half orc back
into the room. They're fighting some people who are dressed like the Zenturum (sp?).

We enter the yard and are attacked by a cult fanatic and two mastiffs. We quickly take care of them and go to the
mansion. We enter the mansion to find two thugs standing over 8 bodies. They immediately attack us.
