When we awake after staying the night in the Troll Skull Inn, we go out to discover that a fireball has exploded and
that there are several corpses. We ask around and hear that someone went toward the bent nail. Someone else tells us
that whatever took something out of the gnome's pocket was not a human, but something that looks like a puppet without
strings. We talk to a young boy that has a necklace that fell into a rain barrel.

We start walking toward Troll Skull Alley and the sergeant comes up to us to ask if we were still investigating. Because
of her involvement, Maeve knows that bodies are frequently taken to a local morgue and clerics are brought in to cast
preservation spells. We learn that the description of the thing that took something out of the rock gnome's pocket
sounds like one of the automota that march in local parades.

Maeve speaks to the owner of the bent nail, Tally, a half-elf who tells us that he hasn't had any customers this
morning. The temple of Gond is in the Sea Ward to the west of us. We walk towards the Temple of Gond. The house of
Inspired Hands looks like a combination between a temple and a workshop. A figure on top of one of the spires releases a
bird into the air which does a couple of flips then veers trowards us. The bird hits Mystiq, and we look up to see where
the automaton is gone.

We enter the temple. A dragonborn priestess approaches us and asks us if she can help us. A nimblewright called Nim was
gifted to the temple by a Lantanese Wizard. Nim is unique because it is conscious. We ask if we can speak with Nim. The
priestess offers to have us follow her. A spiral staircase goes up to a door. She tries the door, and it's locked. She
looks confused and says that she doesn't recognize the lock. We open the door and see Nim trying to hide in the back of
the room.

Nim created another nimblewright recently, and believes that they are the onethat attacked us. Nim created a
nimblewright detector that we can use to find the nimblewright that attacked us. If we destroy the other nimblewright,
the temple will give us 500 GP.
