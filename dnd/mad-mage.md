# Mad Mage

## 2025-07-05

I'm at the Yawning Portal asking about going to the Undermountain. An Orc waitress named Pretty serves me a pint of Mead
and tells me that Durnan is the person I should talk to in order to enter. A tall Tabaxi comes in and asks, so I wander
over. Next a Tiefling ranger wanders over to meet us. We pay to enter the portal.

At the bottom of the entry well is a dark 40' square room. The only exit is a tunnel that heads south before bending
west. There's a thick layer of sand covering the floor. On the walls, we see dented rusty shields covered with
graffiti. Aarrrrgggghhhh does an investigation of the room.

Hallow investigates the shields and finds a poem written on the wall:

Beyond the Pillar Forest
The Mad Mage waits
Casting spells
Beyond magic gates.

We follow the hallway and find a slightly wider hallway with reliefs depecting demons. There's also a Kenku skeleton on
the floor. The carvings on the north wall from east to west depict a Balor, a Barlgura, a Chasme, a Dretch, a Glabrezu,
a Goristro, and a Hezrou. The carvings on the south wall from east to west depict a Marilith, a Nalfeshnee, a Quasit, a
Shadow Demon, a Vrock, and a Yochlol. We search by the Kenku and find a secret door. Hallow checks it for traps and
finds none. Aarrrrgggghhhh breaks open the door and we follow a pathway to a sewer. We see a statue that emits a purple
radiance. Hallow shoots it with an arrow, and a Psychic Gray Ooze appears.

We defeat the Gray Ooze and go back up to the main hallway then downstairs. We find room with a bunch of pillars. One of
the pillars has a warning on the south wall that says certain death this way.
