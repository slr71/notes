I prayed to the temple of Solinari, and received a vision from Solinari. During the vision, I found an amulet of
Solinari.

The fishing village of Volgler clings to a small peninsula. Volgler’s people know little of the evil of people of the
world. The locals are intent on kicking off the kingfisher festival and laying Ispin to rest.

We have rooms available at the Brass Crab Inn.

We meet Becklyn Ufveharin. She was good friends with Ispin, and she comes to greet us when we get to the Brass Crab
Inn. She’s glad that we all got her letter, and we will say goodbye to Ispin tomorrow. We’ll meet in the Brass Crab
after the ceremony, and relive stories. Our feast has been paid for.

We find a temple of Solinari.

We met a woman named Cudgel. She was an old friend of Ispin Greenshield. Ispin used to go to their camps and regale them
with stories.

Becklyn speaks at the service. After the service, she tells a story about Ispin. Ispin was asked to recover a weasel
that was hurled, or at least to note its trajectory. Ispin weathered a week locked in the mountain dwarf kingdom.

After the service, a blue skinned Silvinesti elf is sitting in the corner. She arrived a day before anybody else, and
she knew Ispin. She’s a performer, and she sang a sad song. She leaves as soon as she finishes performing her song.

Before we retire for the evening, Becklyn approaches us. She has something that Ispin left for us. She instructs us to
call for her at the Thornwall Keep in the morning.

In the morning, the town is abuzz with the festival. A young man named Darret offers to give us breakfast.

The keep has veins of bronze colored ivy. Becklyn greets us as we enter. “As you see, there’s not much left of the keep
after the cataclysm. However, we are excavating and finding relics of another age.” Becklyn exits then reenters the room
carrying a shallow wooden box. “Ispin left this, and you can have it on one condition.” Ispin wanted us to participate
in the Kingfisher Festival in his stead.

Cudgel goes to the last attacker and says, “what have you done!?”

Gragonus is the attacker who survived. He was paid by someone wearing plate armor with an emblem of Takhisis

We go to the west and find some tracks. We follow them and find a camp occupied by shadowy figures. A significant
military camp is located a few miles northwest of the village. The force is a mixture of humans and other hooded
figures. The hooded figures have wings and other reptilian features. Becklyn says that these figures sound like
Draconians. She's heard rumors that the Dragon Queen is amassing an army. We've heard rumors of attacks, but nothing was
ever confirmed.

Cudgel went to the mercenary camp. They restratiend several soldiers who were loyal to Gragonus but were unable to
participate in th reenactment.

Lord Bacarus joins the group mid-conversation, insulted that he hasn't been involved. "Look! I'm an important man in
town, and I demand to know what's going on!"

Level up to 3 by next week.
