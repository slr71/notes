## Speech

### Liz

Humor in pain. The video was a little choppy. I wonder if there's a good way to smooth it out a bit.

The video clip was a great example of a joke gone badly. Great sound effects with the laughter. Also great idea to mention the Laughter Yoga.

Disengage hyper-analytical thinking and engage our parasympathetic system.

Great anecdotes, and great images to accomany them.

The idea that you could mold children into anything was even applied to gender as a while, to disastrous effects.

Incredible phrases.

Good at snarking at others. I loved the humor in this speech.

Work is my tether to sanity.

Love doing its cosmic mojo.
