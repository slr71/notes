# Toastmasters Meeting

## Jenn's Speech

I loved your response to my question. I think we're touching on the patholigization of mental health here a little
bit. Mental health, just like physical health, exists on a continuum and can always be improved. I hate the idea that
something has to be _wrong_ with a person in order for mental health treatment to be indicated. We don't pahtologize
physical health to the same degree. For example, someone who goes to the doctor may have a physical illness or they may
be going just for a routine checkup. It would be nice if we could have, for example, periodic mental health checkups.

Ooh! I want to hear more about your data science analyses. I'd like to know how you're structuring and analyzing your
data.

I liked the tone that you struck in the presentation. It was informal while also being informative, and you provided a
lot of really good information. This is a fascinating subject to me, so I'd love to hear more about the work that you
do. This is one case when I think that slide transitions may have helped a little bit. Maybe if you had some slides that
zoom in on sections of your bar graph, it would help to engage the audience without being so distracting that it usurps
their attention.
