## Speech

### Liz (20 minutes)

I liked the introduction containing descriptions of AI in various voices. And the little anecdote about the origins of
the speech.

Good idea to add a list of topics at the beginning of the speech.

You seemed very relaxed throughout the presentation.

Capability to learn things.

Neural Networks
Layers of Neural Networks
Convolutional Layer
Transformer Models
Generative Networks

There were some shifts between details and overview at the beginning. I would have liked a slightly clearer deliniation
between the two.

Convolutional Neural Networks - Images (why)
Recurring Nerual Networks - Interesting Overview (what are they used for?)

Good handing of technical difficulties.

This is the type of topic where illustrations can be very helpful.

Generative Adversarial Networks (good for observational networks)

I loved the humor in the presentation.
