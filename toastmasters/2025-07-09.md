- Amazing home in Bali.
- Life can just be easy for a good three days.
- Enjoying the sun and the scenery.

#### Anna

- I need to write a rubrick.
- How do I score the happiness factor of each thing?
- If you presented this to me on a silver platter.
- If you went there and brought me back a dozen burritos.
- I liked the overarching theme.
- She must have been very strong to have that rug ripped out from under her.
- I liked how these bricks symbolized the transitions.
- Very poingiant visual imagery.
- Literally part of the foundation of your life, and metaphorically part of the foundation of your life.
