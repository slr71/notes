- I love the personal aspect of the introduction to this speech.
- I thought that the tone and the timbre of the speech was perfect.
- I like the way that you tied the topic with the chorus and then went on to discuss some of the hardships that LGBT
  people face.
- The slides were perfect for this type of speech, and I loved the background.
