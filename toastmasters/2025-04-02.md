## Evaluation - Jim Davis

- Great story.
- It was told in chronological order as a sequence of events.
- Good gestures for a little off kilter and circular.
- I liked the escalation in the story followed by a conclusion.
- What I'd really like to know for a story like this is your emotional journey.
