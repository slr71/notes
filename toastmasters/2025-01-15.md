### Anna: A Possible Approach to Antibiotic Resistance

I like the approach of not overpreparing. It can be instructive to do something with very little preparation because you
discover your thoughts as you're speaking sometimes. I've found that some of my speeches where I've deliberately avoided
overpreparation have been some of my best. I have to confess that I've occasionally underprepared, but I don't think
that was the case here. You obviously knew the subject matter and you succeeded at delivering a very well-crafted
presentation.

Good "scratch" and "bombardment" and "divide" gestures. I thought that some of the other gestures could have either been
absent or possibly modified a bit. I fall into the trap where I moved myhands at random, and I thought that you were
falling into it at first as well. You caught yourself about halfway through the speech, though.

I thought that the eye contact could have focused on individual audience members for a just a little bit longer.

I loved the phrase, "I'm killing it with copper."

I really liked the contents of the speech! The discovery of antibiotics and the realization that copper might be a good
tool to use to fight infections in the future!
