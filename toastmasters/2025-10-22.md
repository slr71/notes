## Speeches

### Yevheniia

- It sounded like the speech was being read, which made it a little more difficult to understand.
- Some pauses between sentences and between topics could be helpful.
- For the ABCD slide, I think I'd prefer to have just the names primary approaches and to hear you speak about them.
