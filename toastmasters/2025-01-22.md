## Speeches

### Michele

Good intro to the speech. I liked the way that you introduced the idea of questions about biology, and moved into
questions about chemistry and Physics.

Great gesture for "what does that even look like" and "vibrations." Some of the other gestures seemed to be random hand
movements, which is something that I fall into as well. I've been trying to reduce my random gestures, but that's been a
challenge for me.

"Massive but minuscule." Nice phrase!
"What is it? I have no idea; I just know it exists." Nice phrase!

I also liked the way that you tied the speech back to the observer at the beginning of the speech. Nice touch!
